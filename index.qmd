::: {#hero-heading}
I am a data geek driven by big questions.

As an **economist** and **data scientist**, I work in the health services management team at one of Switzerlandâ€™s largest health insurers. I teach data science at the University of St. Gallen on the side.

My passion lies in **turning data into insight through numbers, simulations, models, and impactful visualizations**. When Iâ€™m not coding or writing, youâ€™ll find me running and biking in the Swiss Alps.

Feel free to **get in touch** using the contact info below ðŸ‘‡
