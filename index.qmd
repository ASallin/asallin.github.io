::: {#hero-heading}
As an **economist** and **data scientist** at a major Swiss healthcare organization, I work with claims data to generate value for our healthcare system, our clients, and our provider partners. I **teach data science** at the University of St. Gallen on the side.

My passion lies in **turning data into insight through numbers, simulations, models, and impactful visualizations**. When I’m not coding, I’m probably running, biking, doing politics for my township, or cooking.

Feel free to **get in touch** using the contact info below 👇
