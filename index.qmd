::: {#hero-heading}
I‚Äôm a data geek driven by big questions üîç.

As an economist and data scientist at a major Swiss healthcare organization, I work with claims data to generate value for our healthcare system, our clients, and our provider partners.

Trained in economics and philosophy, I enjoy R programming and bringing numbers to life through models, simulations, and visualizations. When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm probably running, biking, doing politics with the Green Liberals, or cooking.

Feel free to get in touch!
