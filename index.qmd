::: {#hero-heading}
I am an economist and data scientist at the health services management of one of the largest health insurance companies in Switzerland. By training, I am an economist and philosopher.

My passion lies in R programming and expressing quantitative information using numbers, simulations, models and great visualizations. When not coding or writing, youâ€™ll find me running or bikingðŸš´ðŸ˜Ž, doing politics with the Green liberal party, cooking, and collaborating on the Intergifted project with my wife Jennifer.

Feel free to contact me using my contact informations ðŸ‘‡
