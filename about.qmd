## Data Science and Economics

In the past three years (since 2022), I have been working as a **Senior Economist/Data Scientist** in the **Health Services Management Team** of one of the largest health insurance companies in Switzerland. Our focus lies in the strategic, data-driven development of alternative financing models and the implementation of Value-Based Healthcare approaches.

My role includes conceptualizing and conducting **statistical analyses** based on **claims data**, leading departmental projects on healthcare financing, and using data to monitor costs, evaluate our interventions, and generate value for our insurees. This includes applying methods such as **causal machine learning** and **quasi-experimental designs**. I have presented our research at over ten national and international conferences in health economics, statistics, and population research.

Before, I was an **Economics researcher at the Swiss Institute for Empirical Economic Research (SEW) at the University of St. Gallen (2017-2022)**, where I led projects in education economics and applied econometrics. I published some work on gifted students and their positive effects on their peers.

## Teaching

Since 2023, I've been **teaching introduction to data science using R** as a Lecturer \@ University of St. Gallen. I focus on making statistical concepts accessible and helping students develop practical skills for their future careers in data science, economics, and related fields.

## Other interests

When I’m not analyzing data or teaching, I’m likely outdoors, **running and biking** in the Swiss Alps. I'm also passionate about civic engagement and the R community. Since 2023, I've been a co-organizer of the **[Zürich R User Group](https://zurich-r-user-group.github.io/)**. In 2024, I was elected to the **audit commission** of the municipality of Flawil, where I contribute to local democratic oversight.
