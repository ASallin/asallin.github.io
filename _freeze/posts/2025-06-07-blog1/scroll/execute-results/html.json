We tracked what actually happened to the number of prescriptions.\n\n**The Results?** üëá *Scroll to see the story unfold...*\n\nüìñ **Full Study:** [The impact of Choosing WiselyTM recommendations and insurance coverage restrictions on the provision of low-value care: an interrupted time series analysis of vitamin D tests](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-025-13524-9) [@sallin2025impact]\n\n\\\n\n# Vitamin D and Low-Value Care\n\nHealth systems continue to face the problem of **low-value care**, i.e. services that bring limited benefit to patients while adding costs and administrative effort. Vitamin D testing has become a prominent example.\n\nAlthough clinical guidelines consistently advise against routine testing for low-risk individuals, the use of these tests has continued to rise in many countries. In Switzerland, testing rates almost doubled between 2013 and 2020, from 96 to 199 tests per 1000 inhabitants.\n\n\n## A Policy Response\n\nThis increase led to several policy measures. In April 2021, the **Smarter Medicine initiative**, which is the Swiss equivalent of Choosing Wisely‚Ñ¢, included vitamin D testing in its list of procedures to avoid. The recommendation was simple: no routine measurement of 25(OH)-Vitamin D in patients without risk factors. Physicians were informed of these measures.\n\nA year later, the Federal Office of Public Health introduced a **coverage restriction** (*limitatio*), limiting reimbursement for such tests. Together, these steps offered a natural experiment to observe how clinical recommendations and financial incentives influence medical practice.\n\n\n## Using Real-World Data to Evaluate the Effect\n\nTo examine these changes, we analyzed **mandatory health insurance claims data** from SWICA, covering about 10% of the Swiss population. The data include more than 3'600 general practitioners and group practices, with adult patients who had at least one consultation between 2018 and 2023.\n\nWe applied **interrupted time-series analysis** to estimate how testing volumes evolved around the two interventions. The method compares observed data with a counterfactual trend, which shows what we would expect if the interventions had not taken place.\n\nThe models account for patient characteristics, clinical indications for testing based on Swiss guidelines, and physician-specific prescribing behavior. This allows us to isolate the effect of the policy interventions from broader temporal or compositional changes.\n\n\n## A Multi-Disciplinary Collaboration\n\nThis study is the result of a productive collaboration between the **health services research team at SWICA**, physicians at the **Institute of Primary Care of the University of Z√ºrich**, and health economists at the **Institute of Health Economics and Health Policy of the Bern University of Applied Sciences**.\n\nThis collaboration demonstrates how insights from claims data can advance our understanding of the healthcare system and inform policy decisions aimed at reducing costs for the Swiss population.\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\n## The results in one scroll\n::::{.cr-section}\n\n:::{focus-on=\"cr-plot-layout-I\"}\n\n### Reading the Chart: What Are We Looking At?\n\n<span style=\"color: grey; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;\">‚óè‚óè‚óè</span> **Grey line** = Actual vitamin D tests prescribed each month (real SWICA data)\n\\\n<span style=\"color: #E22920; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;\">‚óè‚óè‚óè</span> **Red line** = What our statistical model predicts should happen\n\\\n<span style=\"color: #00857C; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;\">‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨</span> **Green box** = COVID-19 lockdown period (March-April 2020)\n\\\n**Why this matters:** The red and grey lines track closely together, showing our model accurately captures normal prescribing patterns. This means we can detect when policies actually change physician behavior.\n\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-plot-layout-I}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](scroll_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n:::{focus-on=\"cr-plot-layout-I\"}\n\n### Vitamin D Test Prescriptions Rose Despite Low-Value Status\nDespite clear evidence of low clinical value, vitamin D test prescriptions rose by **20%** between 2018 and 2021.\n\nA textbook example of low-value care in the healthcare system (see also [Obsan 2023](https://www.versorgungsatlas.ch/indicator/_089)).\n\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-plot-layout-I}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](scroll_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n:::{focus-on=\"cr-plot-layout-II\"}\n\n### April 2021: Smarter Medicine Takes Action\n\nSwitzerland's Choosing Wisely‚Ñ¢ campaign places vitamin D testing on their **\"Top 5\"** list of unnecessary procedures.\n\n\\\n\n[![](img/smartermedicine.png){width=\"200px\"}](https://www.smartermedicine.ch/de/home)\n\n\\\n\n**Clear message**: \"No routine testing for patients without risk factors.\"\n\n:::\n\n:::{#cr-plot-layout-II}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](scroll_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{focus-on=\"cr-plot-layout-3\"}\n\n### Clinical Recommendations: Modest Impact\nThe Smarter Medicine recommendation shows a **slight downward trend**.\n\nBut is this enough?

However, our analysis revealed important nuances.\n\nWe found **no unintended consequences** from the coverage limitation: vitamin D supplementation rates remained unaffected, suggesting the policy successfully targeted testing without compromising appropriate treatment.\n\nHowever, from a health policy perspective, simply removing procedures from basic insurance coverage cannot be the default solution for addressing unnecessary treatments. This regulatory approach creates high administrative burden for physicians.\n\n**A more sustainable solution** lies in strengthening financial incentives that align provider and payer interests. In Switzerland, this can be achieved through **managed care contracts** between physician networks and health insurers within alternative insurance models. These contracts establish quality standards while creating shared financial responsibility among physicians‚Äîencouraging appropriate care delivery without heavy-handed regulation.\n",
