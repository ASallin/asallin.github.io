These steps are usually not covered in economics programs, where the focus lies mostly on statistics and econometrics. However, applied work starts earlier: finding relevant data, importing it, cleaning it, merging it, and summarising it. This is represented by the **data pipeline workflow**, which forms the backbone of the course.\n\n![](cache/data_science_pipeline.png){fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"The Data Pipeline\" width=\"60%\"}\n\nTo make these steps concrete, we applied the pipeline to an economic question in a group project: **Do higher health expenditures buy better health?** Students worked with real-world data on life expectancy and perceived health status to investigate whether and how spending relates to outcomes. This setup allows students to practice the technical steps in data handling while engaging with a topic that raises real economic questions.\n\n<br>\n\n## A data handling project linking health spending and health outcomes\n\nThe question of whether higher health expenditures lead to better health outcomes is a recurring theme in health economics. Spending is positively associated with outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, while the relationship is weaker in high-income settings (\"plateau effect\"). The United States and Switzerland are a well-known case: high spending with comparatively lower outcomes (@anderson2003s).\n\nFor this project, students worked with international data to examine **three hypotheses**:\n\n  1. Higher health expenditures are associated with higher life expectancy.\n  2. Higher health expenditures are associated with better perceived health status.\n  3. The marginal gains from health spending are smaller in high-income settings than in lower-income settings.\n\nStudents were guided through the technical steps: retrieving data through APIs, cleaning datasets, merging sources, and exploring basic patterns. In this project, they learned the core skills that applied economists need when working with data.\n\n<br>\n\n\n## Retrieving data through APIs\n\nBecause international economic analysis relies on reproducible data pulls, APIs are becoming standard tools in applied work. Students retrieved **data on health expenditures from the World Bank API** using API wrappers such as `WDI` in R, or by programming their own API wrapper. We focused on three indicators:\n\n  - *Current health expenditure per capita (in current US$)*\n  - *Current health expenditure (% of GDP)*\n  - *Current health expenditure per capita, PPP (current international $)*\n\n**Data on perceived health status was retrieved from the OECD API** through the `OECD` package. Accessing data through APIs introduces students to reproducible workflows and avoids manual downloading. To support this part of the project, Minna Heim from the KOF Institute gave a guest lecture on working with APIs.\n\nEarly steps involved filtering out irrelevant observations (e.g., aggregates or gender-specific data) and standardising variable names and formats across datasets. Data cleaning is where the magic of data science often happens.\n\n<br>\n\n## Know your data\n\n> \"To not mislead others and not embarrass yourself, know your data\". (Jeremy G. Weber)\n\n![](cache/4questionsKnowYourData.svg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\nWe emphasized the four basic questions to apply to a new dataset before going deeper into analysis. This part is inspired by Jeremy G. Weber's \"Statistics for Public Policy\", 2024.\n\n  1. **Definitions**: what exactly is being measured. Many economic indicators are constructed rather than natural facts (e.g. poverty rates, unemployment, costs).\n  2. **Units**: in which quantities the variable is expressed (e.g. liters or gallons, USD or PPP, per capita or totals, etc.). This also covers scale: percentages vs shares, per capita vs totals, logs vs levels.\n  3. **Quality and plausibility**: spotting measures and values that are unrealistic or inconsistent with other data sources (e.g. outliers).\n  4. **Unit of observation**: what one observation represents (e.g. country or country-year). This clarifies the relevant population and the level of analysis. Is the dataset a panel, a cross-section, a repeated cross-section, or a time series?\n\nThese points are relevant for this project. The choice between USD, PPP, or percentage of GDP for health expenditures affects interpretation, as do definitions of perceived health status. Students noticed how much interpretation depends on definitions, units, and the underlying data architecture.\n\n<br>\n\n## Merging sources and exploring the data\n\nThe datasets were merged at the country-year level. This step raises practical questions about missing values, sample composition, and representativeness. World Bank variables merge well but contain missing values in some indicators. When adding OECD data, join choice affects the resulting sample. For example, an inner join restricts the sample to OECD countries, while a left or full join retains more information at the cost of missingness. These decisions influence the interpretation of results and illustrate the real-world challenges of working with data from different sources.\n\nThis part connected to concepts seen in the course: panel structures, join types, and handling missing data. It illustrated that empirical work in economics involves many decisions before any model is estimated.\n\n<br>\n\n## Measuring health expenditures\n\nHealth expenditures can be expressed in different ways. In this project we explored **three common indicators**: **expenditure per capita in USD, expenditure per capita in Purchasing-Power-Parity (PPP) terms, and expenditure as a share of GDP**. These indicators do not tell the same story. USD reflects nominal spending power, PPP adjusts for differences in price levels, and the GDP share indicates how much of a country’s output is given to health care.\n\nFor cross-country comparisons, PPP is usually more informative because it accounts for cost-of-living differences. Using USD tends to exaggerate gaps between countries with different price levels, and the GDP share can look high in countries with smaller economies even when absolute health spending is low. This also affects interpretation of cases such as the United States, where high spending in USD and PPP terms coexists with lower outcomes.\n\n![](cache/health_expenditure_time.png){fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"Description of the image\" width=\"60%\"}\n\nStudents were asked to look at expenditures in USD and as share of GDP, discuss observed trends, and compare indicators. We clearly saw a pattern of **increasing per capita healthcare spending for high-income countries** since 2000, whereas expenditures in countries in the lower income bracket increased slower. On average, high-income countries dedicated 8.1% of GDP for health in 2022.\n\n<br>\n\n## Measuring health outcomes: life expectancy and perceived health status\nWe used **two outcomes**: **life expectancy (from the World Bank) and perceived health status (from the OECD)**. Life expectancy is a widely used indicator of population health and correlates with many determinants of health. Perceived health status captures how individuals evaluate their own health and varies across countries for both health-related and cultural reasons. Students were asked to reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of using these measures as proxies for health quality.\n\nDifferences in perceived health status are informative but harder to compare across countries because reporting styles, expectations, and social norms influence responses. This makes it possible for two countries with similar health systems to display different levels of reported health.\n\n\n::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](cache/life_expectancy_income_groups.png){fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"Graph 1: Life expectancy by country\" width=\"90%\"}\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](cache/oecd_health_status_avg.png){fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"Graph 2: Perceived health status by country\" width=\"90%\"}\n:::\n:::\n\nLife expectancy is highly correlated with income brackets. We observe a Covid effect especially in middle income countries. Average perceived health status in OECD countries navigated between 65% and 70% since 2005, which is stable in comparison to increases in expenditures.\n\n<br>\n\n## The final story: insights and visualization\n\nThe relationship between expenditures and outcomes confirms the hypotheses. **Higher spending is associated with higher life expectancy, but the gains flatten at higher levels of spending (diminishing returns).** This is particularly impressive for two outlier countries: Switzerland and the US.\n\n![](cache/spending_vs_life_2022.png){fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"Description of the image\" width=\"80%\"}\n\nFor perceived health status, the association is weaker and only observable for OECD countries. Cultural and reporting differences play a larger role, and countries with similar levels of spending can report different levels of perceived health.\n\nAt the end of the project, **students were asked to reflect and communicate their results through a short LinkedIn post**. This forced them to translate an analytical workflow into a clear narrative for a broader audience.\n\nSome groups chose a **more classic academic narrative** (<span style='color:#6c757d;'>\"Our analysis examines how healthcare spending relates to population health across income groups.\"</span>), while others adopted a **more polemic or provocative tone 😎** <span style='color:#6c757d;'>(with titles like \"💡The Wealth-Health Gap: Money Buys Years, But Only Up To A Point\", \"What keeps people healthy longer – money or something more?\", or \"Greedy Big Pharma or drivers of longer lives? As ageing, long COVID and tight budgets strain health systems, one question matters: are we buying more health or just spending more money?\")</span>. The range of styles showed that data can support different narratives, as long as the underlying work is sound.\n\n<br>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis project combines data handling with economic reasoning. Students worked with real data, used reproducible workflows, and examined how measurement choices affect conclusions. The exercise shows how data science and health economics meet in practice, and how young economists can now work with data in ways that lead to meaningful and interesting economic conclusions.\n\nAs the instructor, it was **encouraging to see how quickly students could implement the full data pipeline** and arrive at their own data-informed conclusions once they worked with real data. The way we teach data science has changed significantly in the past three years with the rise of large language models. Teaching data science and coding in 2025 is not the same as in 2022: in my experience, students are more effective at producing results with code, but less likely to understand every step in detail.\n\nThis project emphasised the understanding of each step while still enabling students to complete a full analysis. Only a few years ago, delivering such an end-to-end pipeline would have been unlikely at the bachelor level; today it has become achievable and rewarding for students 🏆🎯✅.\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis course was originally created by [Ulrich Matter](https://umatter.github.io/).
