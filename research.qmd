**"The impact of Choosing WiselyTM recommendations and insurance coverage restrictions on the provision of low-value care: an interrupted time series analysis of vitamin D tests"** published in *BMC Health Services Research*

[Read Study](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-025-13524-9) | [Check my summary blog post (with cool graphs!)](/posts/2025-06-07-blog1/scroll.html)

\

#### ðŸ“Š **Key findings:**
Clinical recommendations alone are insufficient to reduce low-value care in the case of Vit D tests. Insurance coverage restrictions proved more effective than guidelines, reducing unnecessary vitamin D testing by 62% and saving 15.65 million CHF annually. However, coverage restrictions increase administrative burden and risk underuse.
