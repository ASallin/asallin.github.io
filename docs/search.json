The number of tests per consultation falls by 4.9% [-5.3%, -4.5%] after the recommendation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2022: Financial Reality Hits\nThe Federal Office of Public Health restricts coverage.

This is a dramatic drop compared to clinical recommendations alone.\nThe number of tests per consultation falls by 62% [-62.4%, -61.6%] The 6-month cumulated effect is -60% [-60.0%, 59.0%].\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line: 15.65 Million CHF Saved\nHealthcare system savings of 15.65 million CHF in 2022 alone.\nThat’s 1.8 CHF per Swiss resident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings and Policy Implications\nClinical recommendations alone proved less effective than government regulation in reducing low-value care in Switzerland—but our analysis revealed important nuances.\nWe found no unintended consequences from the coverage limitation: vitamin D supplementation rates remained unaffected, suggesting the policy successfully targeted testing without compromising appropriate treatment.\nHowever, from a health policy perspective, simply removing procedures from basic insurance coverage cannot be the default solution for addressing unnecessary treatments. This regulatory approach creates administrative burden.\nA more sustainable solution lies in strengthening financial incentives that align provider and payer interests. In Switzerland, this can be achieved through managed care contracts between physician networks and health insurers within alternative insurance models. These contracts establish quality standards while creating shared financial responsibility among physicians—encouraging appropriate care delivery without heavy-handed regulation."

This means we can detect when policies actually change physician behavior.\n\n\n\n\nVitamin D Test Prescriptions Rose Despite Low-Value Status\nDespite clear evidence of low clinical value, vitamin D test prescriptions rose by 20% between 2018 and 2021.\nA textbook example of low-value care in the healthcare system (see also Obsan 2023).\n\n\n\n\nApril 2021: Smarter Medicine Takes Action\nSwitzerland’s Choosing Wisely™ campaign places vitamin D testing on their “Top 5” list of unnecessary procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nClear message: “No routine testing for patients without risk factors.”\n\n\n\n\nClinical Recommendations: Modest Impact\nThe Smarter Medicine recommendation shows a slight downward trend.\nBut is this enough? Let’s compare with what would have happened without intervention…\n\n\n\n\nRevealing the Counterfactual\nThe teal dashed line shows what would have happened without the recommendation.\nTesting rates would have continued climbing upward.\n\n\n\n\nThe Numbers: Clinical Recommendations Work, But Modestly\nWe conduct statistical tests to see whether the recommendation led to a recognizable pattern. The number of tests per consultation falls by 5.98% in the 12 months following the recommendation.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2022: Strong Regulatory Measure\n\n\nThe Federal Office of Public Health restricts coverage. Patients now pay out-of-pocket for routine tests.\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Incentives: The Game Changer\nThe number of tests per consultation drops by 57.82% in the 6 months following the coverage restriction. This is a dramatic drop compared to clinical recommendations alone.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line: 15.65 Million CHF Saved\nHealthcare system savings of 15.65 million CHF in 2022 alone.\nThat’s 1.8 CHF per Swiss resident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_vitd_masked(dfgraph, counterfactualM, mask_from = -16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_vitd_masked(dfgraph, counterfactualM, mask_from = -16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_vitd_masked(dfgraph, counterfactualM, mask_from = -15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_vitd_masked(dfgraph, counterfactualM, mask_from = -1, mask_counterfactual_from = -15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_vitd_masked(dfgraph, counterfactualM, mask_from = -1, mask_counterfactual_from = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_vitd_masked(dfgraph, counterfactualM, mask_from = -1, mask_counterfactual_from = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_vitd_masked(dfgraph, counterfactualM, mask_from = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_vitd_masked(dfgraph, counterfactualM, mask_from = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_vitd_masked(dfgraph, counterfactualM, mask_from = NULL)"
