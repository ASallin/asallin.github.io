    "text": "How to: do Strava map art with R\nThis map is a nice excuse to play with the Strava API, Open Street Maps, R, ggplot, and my favorite color tones. Here is a step-by-step explanation on how I coded the map. The full commented code is also available directly in this blog.\n\nStep 1: Set up R\nFirst, install and load the necessary libraries. I use the rStrava package to connect to the Strava API and download my activities, and osmdata + ggplot2 to visualize them on OpenStreetMap. Fonts are added using showtext.\n\n\nShow R code for package loading\n# Strava API wrapper\nlibrary(rStrava)\n\n# OpenStreetMap and sf for polygons\nlibrary(osmdata)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(googleway) # Convert polygons from Rstrava to sf\n\n# Standard tidyverse\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Add fonts for my graphs\nlibrary(showtext)\nfont_add_google(\"Fira Sans\", \"Fira Sans\")  \nfont_add_google(\"Bebas Neue\", \"Bebas Neue\")\nshowtext_auto()\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 2: Get the data from Strava using the rStrava API wrapper\nI followed the rStrava vignette to authenticate with the API and access my activities. I extract my activities, keep only rides and runs, and save them as CSVs to avoid re-downloading every time. The activity data includes a compressed polyline (Google format) with GPS coordinates. I decode them into usable line geometries to visualize the actual paths of each activity.\nIn a second step, I use decode_pl() to extract the GPS coordinates from each activity’s polyline. Then I convert them to LINESTRING geometries — after all, rides are linear paths, and Strava doesn’t know random walks 😬🥁.\n\n\nShow R code for interaction with the Strava API\n# Check if I already downloaded and saved my activities. If not, connect \n# to the API and extract data. \nstrava_file &lt;- here::here(\"posts/blog2_strava/cache/strava_run.csv\")\n\nif (!file.exists(strava_file)) {\n\n    app_name      &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"STRAVA_APP_NAME\")\n    app_client_id &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"STRAVA_CLIENT_ID\")\n    app_secret    &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET\")\n\n    stopifnot(nzchar(app_client_id), nzchar(app_secret))\n\n    # create the authentication token\n    stoken &lt;- httr::config(\n      token = strava_oauth(\n        app_name, \n        app_client_id, \n        app_secret, \n        app_scope=\"activity:read_all\")\n      )\n\n    # get activities by date range\n    my_acts &lt;- get_activity_list(stoken, after = as.Date('2021-01-01'))\n    act_data &lt;- compile_activities(my_acts, units = \"metric\") \n\n    # Prepare data\n    my_acts &lt;- act_data |&gt;\n      select(\n        id, start_date, type, name, lat = start_latlng1, lng = start_latlng2, \n        map.summary_polyline\n      ) |&gt;\n      filter(type %in% c(\"Run\", \"Ride\")) \n\n    count(my_acts, type)\n\n    # Save data per activity\n    filter(my_acts, type == \"Run\") |&gt;\n        write_csv(here::here(\"posts/blog2_strava/cache/strava_run.csv\"))\n    filter(my_acts, type == \"Ride\") |&gt;\n        write_csv(here::here(\"posts/blog2_strava/cache/strava_ride.csv\"))\n\n} else {\n    my_acts &lt;- bind_rows(\n        read_csv(here::here(\"posts/blog2_strava/cache/strava_run.csv\")),\n        read_csv(here::here(\"posts/blog2_strava/cache/strava_ride.csv\"))\n    )\n}\n\n\n\n\nShow R code for activity preparation\n# Import polygons using a custom function\nmake_lines_sf &lt;- function(df) {\n  \n  # Initialize new vector for results\n  res &lt;- vector(\"list\", nrow(df))\n\n  # Control flow\n  for (j in seq_len(nrow(df))) {\n\n    coords &lt;- tryCatch(\n      googleway::decode_pl(df$map.summary_polyline[j]),\n      error = function(e) NULL\n    )\n    if (is.null(coords)) next\n\n    coords &lt;- coords |&gt; \n        filter(!is.na(lat), !is.na(lon))\n    \n    if (nrow(coords) &lt; 2) next\n\n    # Transform to lines\n    ls &lt;- st_linestring(as.matrix(coords[, c(\"lon\", \"lat\")]))\n\n    # Store\n    res[[j]] &lt;- st_sf(\n      id = df$id[j],\n      type = as.character(df$type[j]),\n      geometry = st_sfc(ls, crs = 4326)\n    )\n  }\n\n  out &lt;- do.call(rbind, res[!vapply(res, is.null, logical(1))])\n  out\n}\n\nmy_acts &lt;- my_acts |&gt; \n  mutate(year = lubridate::year(start_date))\n\nacts_lines &lt;- make_lines_sf(my_acts) |&gt;\n  mutate(year = my_acts$year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create a map with all running and biking activities in 2025\nMy first map will be used as a post on Strava to wish my community a happy 2026.\nAs the basic structure of the map, I define a bounding box for Eastern Switzerland (from Zürich to Bregenz, Konstanz to Luzern). That’s where most of my activities take place. I went biking and running in Western Switzerland and Spain, which I will not show on the map. I extract the main roads from OpenStreetMap using add_osm_feature()and cache them to a .gpkg file to avoid re-downloading.\nOnce the activities and the map have been prepared, use ggplot() and geom_sf to plot the map rectangle, the street lines, and the activities. I chose among two favorite color palettes to display the map in a nice artistic way. I also chose a font that I thought would go well with the overall design.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow R code for the map and street preparation\n# We create a rectangle around Eastern Switzerland\nbb_rect &lt;- st_as_sfc(st_bbox(c(\n  xmin = 8, xmax = 9.7,\n  ymin = 46.75, ymax = 47.85\n), crs = 4326))\n\n\n# We extract the street polygons from OpenStreetMap\nroads_file &lt;- here::here(\"posts/blog2_strava/cache/roads.gpkg\")\n\nif (!file.exists(roads_file)) {\n\n  streets &lt;- opq(st_bbox(bb_rect)) |&gt;\n    add_osm_feature(\n      key = \"highway\",\n      value = c(\"motorway\", \"primary\", \"secondary\", \"tertiary\")\n    ) |&gt;\n    osmdata_sf()\n\n  streets_lines &lt;- streets$osm_lines\n\n  dir.create(dirname(roads_file), showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)\n\n  sf::st_write(\n    streets_lines,\n    roads_file,\n    layer = \"roads\",\n    delete_layer = TRUE,\n    quiet = TRUE\n  )\n\n} else {\n\n  streets_lines &lt;- sf::st_read(\n    roads_file,\n    layer = \"roads\",\n    quiet = TRUE\n  )\n\n}\n\n# I don't restrict the rectangle as much for the activity maps.

    "section": "A Policy Response",
    "text": "A Policy Response\nThis increase led to several policy measures. In April 2021, the Smarter Medicine initiative, which is the Swiss equivalent of Choosing Wisely™, included vitamin D testing in its list of procedures to avoid. The recommendation was simple: no routine measurement of 25(OH)-Vitamin D in patients without risk factors. Physicians were informed of these measures.\nA year later, the Federal Office of Public Health introduced a coverage restriction (limitatio), limiting reimbursement for such tests. Together, these steps offered a natural experiment to observe how clinical recommendations and financial incentives influence medical practice."

    "section": "Using Real-World Data to Evaluate the Effect",
    "text": "Using Real-World Data to Evaluate the Effect\nTo examine these changes, we analyzed mandatory health insurance claims data from SWICA, covering about 10% of the Swiss population. The data include more than 3’600 general practitioners and group practices, with adult patients who had at least one consultation between 2018 and 2023.\nWe applied interrupted time-series analysis to estimate how testing volumes evolved around the two interventions. The method compares observed data with a counterfactual trend, which shows what we would expect if the interventions had not taken place.\nThe models account for patient characteristics, clinical indications for testing based on Swiss guidelines, and physician-specific prescribing behavior. This allows us to isolate the effect of the policy interventions from broader temporal or compositional changes."

    "text": "Key Findings and Policy Implications\nClinical recommendations alone proved less effective than government regulation in reducing low-value care in Switzerland. However, our analysis revealed important nuances.\nWe found no unintended consequences from the coverage limitation: vitamin D supplementation rates remained unaffected, suggesting the policy successfully targeted testing without compromising appropriate treatment.\nHowever, from a health policy perspective, simply removing procedures from basic insurance coverage cannot be the default solution for addressing unnecessary treatments. This regulatory approach creates high administrative burden for physicians.\nA more sustainable solution lies in strengthening financial incentives that align provider and payer interests. In Switzerland, this can be achieved through managed care contracts between physician networks and health insurers within alternative insurance models. These contracts establish quality standards while creating shared financial responsibility among physicians—encouraging appropriate care delivery without heavy-handed regulation."
